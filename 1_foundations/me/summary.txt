My name is Jignesh Panchal, I'm an IT Architect, developer and curious learner. I'm originally from India but moved to Europe in 2010. I love traveling, watching movies and I am an avid food enthusiast. I like to try different cuisines, strictly vegetarian though! I like to read books, watching cricket day long, and keep everything organized around me.
